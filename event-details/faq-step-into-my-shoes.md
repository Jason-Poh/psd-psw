### Frequently Asked Questions - for Interested Officers
<ol type="1">
	<li>
		<b>Who do I contact if I am interested in a specific role?</b><br>
		Please indicate your interest through the Eventbrite page for each Step into My Shoes attachment/ internship. Thereafter, you will liaise directly with the host agency representative. 
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>How will I know if I'm selected and how much time do I have before I report to the agency?</b><br>
		Attachements/Internships can start as soon as possible (upon mutual agreement by yourself, host agency, and any internal approvals that you need to get with your reporting officer). Each host agency will have its own process or criteria for selecting the most suitable officer(s) for the attachment/internship. Some host agencies amy require you to complete an application form(s) or provide CV or undertake an interview. The host agency will let you know once your attachment if confirmed.
	</li>

	<li> 
		<b>What will happen to my current work?</b><br>
		As the duration of attachment varies (few days to 6 months), you will need to discuss with your reporting officer on who will be covering your current work during the attachment period. Please make sure that you have made necessary arrangements prior to commencing your attachment.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>How long is the attachment?</b><br>
		The programme is meant for short-tearm attachments i.e. a few days up to a maximum of 6 months.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Will I still have a place at my current agency at the end of the programme?</b><br>
		Yes. As the programme is a short-term attachment, you will return to your current agency at the end of the programme.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Do I need to seek my director's approval to participate in the programme?</b><br>
		We recommend that you discuss with your reporting officer on whether you need to inform your Director and HR of your participation in the programme.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>How will I be paid?</b>
		This programme is meant more for short-term attachments (half a day to a few months), in which case there would not be expectation to have salary transfers from the organising agency, as your  agency would also be benefitting from the programme. 
		<br>
		<br>
		For longer term attachments (i.e. secondments), we suggest that you discuss with your HR with regards to your salary and benefits entitlement. For your information, there is a government IM on compensation.

	</li>

	<li>
		<b>Am I able to drop out in the middle of the programme?</b>
		It is not advisable to drop out before the programme ends. As the host agency has planned out the programme for participants, you might not reap the full benefits of the programme if you decide to leave midway. 
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>I've changed my mind. What should I do?</b><br>
		You will need to inform the host agency directly, as soon as possible.
	</li>

	<li>
		<b>How can I make the most out of this learning experience?</b><br>
		We encourage you to clarify your learning intentions or outcomes that you wish to achieve through this attachment/ internship opportunity, and discuss these with the host agency and your own supervisor/reporting officer at your 'home' agency. It is also a good practice to reflect on your experience and learning during and post-attachment, and share these with your host agency and even with colleagues back at your workplace. How about host a post-internship lunch and share session in your officer or place a refelction post on Workplace? Be creative. :)

### Frequently Asked Questions - for Supervisors/Reporting Officers
<ol type="1">
<li>
	<b>How long will the officer by away?</b><br>
	The programme is meant for short-term attachments. Hence, the officer will be away for a few days up to a maximum of 6 months.
</li>

<li>
	<b>How will Step in My Shoes benefit the officer</b><br>
	Officers will gain an understanding of how other agencies' work contribute to a broader Public Service outcomes. We suggest that you discuss with the officer and evaluate if this programme adds value to the officer's career.
</li>

<li>
	<b>Do I have to submit any form/report for the officer's participation in Step into My Shoes</b><br>
	This is up to the host agency to decide. We have recommended to host agencies to prepare official application forms (for reporting officers' endorsement), to facilitate mutual understanding between the host agency and the participant. We have also recommended that host agencies request for a report from the officer on what they have learnt during the attachment. Each host agency will have the discretion to identify and confirm suitable officers for the attachment.  
</li>

<li>
	<b>If my officer is keen to participate in the short-term Step into My Shoes attachment, do they need to apply for annual leave so that they are excused from work during that period? </b><br>
	We would like to encourage supervisors/reporting officers to be as suportive of this pilot initiative and of your officer's interest to learn and grow. As such, we advocate that officers can be excused from their work duties <u>without</u> having to apply for annual leave as long as their supervisor/reporting officer gives approval. In addition, we recommend that the officer shares with the supervisor/reporting officer with information about the agreed planned date(s) and duration of the attachment, who is the host agency and department, and the specified learning outcomes of the attachment. We also highly encourage the officer to have discussions with the supervisor/reporting officer on any covering duties arrangement(s) that need to be put in place whilst the officer is away on attachment, especially for attachments that last for more than a few days. 
</li>

<li>
	<b>How else can I best support my officer in preparing for the Step into My Shoes attachment?</b><br>
	We recommend supervisor/ reporting officers and the interested officer have discussions on learning outcomes or learning objectives and any other expectations about the short-term attachment. Learning outcomes/ objectives could even include sharing of the experience upon return to the "home' agency or strengthening relationships and connections between the two agencies. We also highly encourage the officer to have discussions with the supervisor/reporting officer on any covering duties arrangement(s) that need to be put in place whilst the officer is away on attachment, especially for attachments that last for more than a few days.
</li>

<li>
	<b>Does my agency need to have a one-on-one exchange of officers whilst my officer is on attachment?</b><br>
	No, this will not be necessary
