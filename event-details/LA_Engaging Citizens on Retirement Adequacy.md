## Learning Activity
### CPF: Engaging Singaporeans on Retirement Adequacy

###### _#Engage_

As the comprehensive social security system for all Singaporeans and Permanent Residents, Central Provident Fund Board (CPFB) has continually refined our communications, across multiple channels to ensure that members understand the key features of the various CPF schemes.

Through this talk, you will better appreciate CPF as intended for retirement adequacy. Through case studies, you will understand how to discern facts from the increasing incidence of DRUMS* on social media that are targeted at CPF schemes, and CPFBâ€™s evolving efforts to deal with these DRUMS.

<i>*DRUMS is an acronym for Disruption, Rumours, Untruths, Misinformation and Smears</i>
