## Learning Activity
### Improving Our Lives Through Automation by GovTech Singapore

###### _#Digitalise #Adapt&SkillUp_

Want to find out how you can free up time and spend it more meaningfully on productive work? 

Learn how to automate routine tasks, such as extracting data from a web page, filling up web forms from an Excel or CSV document, and automating a web task. All these can be done through KANTU, a Chrome browser extension. 

Lunch will be provided. Bring along your personal internet-accessible laptop if possible.
