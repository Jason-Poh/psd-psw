## Learning Activity
### Improving Soldier Performance Through Science

###### #SPSPride_

Join us in this learning journey to understand how the Centre of Excellence for Solider Performance (CESP) is transforming the way our soliders are trained and equipped through exploiting the advances in the sciences, with the aim of enhancing safety and minimising training attrition. 

Come and see how CESP's programmes train soliders to be physically and mentally stronger, and also the effects to rehabilitate our injured soliders. You will also get better understanding of how solider systems are now developed with a heavy emphasis on equipment ergonomics.
