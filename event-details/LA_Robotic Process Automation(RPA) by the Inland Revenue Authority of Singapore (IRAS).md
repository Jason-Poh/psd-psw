## Learning Activity 
### Robotic Process Automation(RPA) by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) 

How is Robotic Process Automation(RPA) relevant to everyone? Learn how IRAS has employed RPA to automate more than 70 manual and repetitive tasks in its pilot phase; and the subsequent scale-ups and staff empowerment to acquire new digital skill sets to allow RPA be pervasively embraced as an End User Computing tool instead of a mere IT-driven solution.
