<br> For the first time, the Public Service Week Learning Festival is going fully virtual and we have partnered with the <b>Amalgamated Union of Public Employees (AUPE)</b> <hyperlink to AUPE’s website> to curate the learning sessions for this year.

We have put together a lineup of virtual learning sessions hosted by government agencies and a series of online bite-sized LEARN modules that you can access in your own time. Work out your “learning muscles” by hearing from various government agencies, developing current and/or new skills, and exploring new ideas with public officers from different agencies.

<b>JOIN A LEARNING WORKOUT.</b>

Explore the learning sessions (also known as “Workouts”) by selecting any of the four categories below.

Hearing what others have done can often inspire us to do better for Our Future Public Service. The virtual sessions are hosted by different agencies and each demonstrates one of Our Core Competencies (OCC) in action. If you would like to pick up a new skill to develop a specific core competency, choose from a series of bite-sized LEARN modules specially curated for this Learning Festival.
