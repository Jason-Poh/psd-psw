Bite-sized -  Participate in teaser sessions that provide sneak previews (‘warm-up’) of full training programmes available (full workout)

Curated –  Access a customised work-out to gain new muscles to adapt to rapid changes in specific jobs; you can even adopt job persona-specific ‘workouts’ in some cases

Virtual – Choose from a mixture of live online sessions* as well as self-directed learning resources that you can access at your own time; there is surely something for everyone

Wide-ranging– Get quick tips and pointers for work and life no matter what career or life stage you are at, including digital and financial literacy and career management
