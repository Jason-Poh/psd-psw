      <b>Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration - Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS)</b>
      <br>22 October 2020,  3.00pm - 5.00pm | Platform: Zoom
      <br>      
      <br>PSWLF committee has invited PEERS Office to consider hosting a virtual sharing session about the Partners Engaging and Empowering Rough Sleepers (PEERS) Network. The committee is finding this to be very relevant for the theme on “Work – Transforming how we serve citizens and businesses as One Public Service”, particularly on how MSF works closely with social service agencies and community groups to support ground-up initiatives for homeless persons and rough sleepers. As our Public Service moves towards increased collaboration and co-creation between agencies, and with external stakeholders, the committee has assessed that the PEERS Network will be a good learning point for other agencies who are thinking of similar initiatives. Additionally, the COVID-19 situation has brought about new challenges that would be interesting areas of learning, especially in navigating the way we work. For the PSWLF virtual sharing session, some key points that would be useful to include are what the PEERS Network is about, key considerations to make in a multi-stakeholder collaboration, some of the challenges faced (and how to overcome them), as well as highlighting some memorable experiences that have arisen from this initiative
      <br>Learning objectives:
      <br>1. Gain insights on how to work collaboratively and co-create solutions with external stakeholders to deliver better services to citizens 
      <br>2. Understand the benefits and challenges of collaboration (with some insights from the COVID situation as well) and how to navigate them
