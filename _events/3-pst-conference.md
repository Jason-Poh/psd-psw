**Time and Date:** 18 July 2019
<br>**Venue:** Festive Arts Theatre, Our Tampines Hub
<br> *The PST Conference is open for Public Officers who have signed up for the event. A confirmation e-mail is required for admission.*
<br>
<br>
To be held on 18 July, this year’s PST Conference theme – Public Services Redesigned: The Service Journey Approach – aims to inspire and encourage public officers, especially those in Service Design and implementation roles, to revisit, rethink and redefine service delivery. <br>
<br>
Join us at the PST conference to hear from local and international Service Design leaders from both the public service and the industry. Whether it’s looking at public services from the perspective of key moments of a citizen's life or making G2B transactions seamless, come learn about the policy considerations, capabilities required, and business and technical challenges to be addressed. <br>
<br>
This year, there will also be related Service Design Learning Journeys, Workshops and Consultation Clinics happening in the afternoon to reinforce learnings from the conference with first-hand experiences. Participants may select their preferred activity for the afternoon session, subject to availability, during registration. The PST Conference is part of Public Service Week 2019.
