### PST Conference 
![PST Conference](/images/Conference_Banner.png)
This year’s Public Sector Transformation Conference 2019 is themed Redesigning Public Service Delivery: The Service Journey Approach. It aims to inspire and encourage public officers, especially those in service design and implementation roles, to rethink service delivery from the citizens’ point of view.
<br>
<br>
Join us in hearing from experts and practitioners helming service design projects and initiatives in both the public and private sector, and to gain insights about the trending developments in public service transformation efforts. 
<br>
<br>
As part of the programme, conference attendees can also sign up for on-site learning journeys at companies that have adopted a Service Design approach, such as Grab and OCBC; and Service Journey foundation workshops. 
<br>
<br>
More details on the conference and learning activities will be announced, so stay tuned!
