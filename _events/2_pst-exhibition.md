**Time and Date:** 17 & 18 July 2019, 9:00am - 6:00pm<br>
**Venue:** Community Auditorium, Our Tampines Hub

<br>

As public officers, our work impacts the everyday lives of Singaporeans – our family, friends, and not least ourselves. However, are we familiar with the various government services available at each life stage? <br>
<br>
This year, a unique and different Public Sector Transformation (PST) Exhibition brings us through everyday questions and issues across the minds of Singaporeans at key moments in their life. <br>
<br>
Don’t miss out on this opportunity to stay updated with the latest across the public service and to connect with old friends! <br>
<br>
<br>
Registration for Exhibition opens 25th Jun!<br>

### Here's what you can expect at the Exhibition! 
#### Service Journeys
<b>Service Journeys</b> are processes to help public officers understand Singaporeans’ needs though the journeys with us. Through these processes, we create new products and services, and reorganise ourselves to improve the journeys so they are as pleasant as possible.
<br>
<br>
Get to understand and be part of seven main service journeys of a typical Singaporean adult who goes through these stages in his/her life.
