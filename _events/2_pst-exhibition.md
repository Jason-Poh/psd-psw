<b>An exhibition not to be missed </b> <br>
As public service officers, our work impacts the everyday lives of Singaporeans – our family, friends, and not least ourselves. But how familiar are you with the various services available at each life stage? <br>
This year, the Public Service Transformation Exhibition shares answers to everyday questions and issues across the minds of Singaporeans at four key moments in their life: <br> 
<br>
<ul> 
<li> Working Life – read lesser-known advice you wish you knew before your first job, to data and industry trends to help you stay ahead of your personal curve as work demands change </li>
<li> Parenthood – understand the joys and benefits of being a parent, through financial aid for your child from birth to school, as well as information on the new offerings and pedagogy of our education system </li>
<li> The Golden Years – life is beautiful, and it should be. Get connected to communities, try exciting programmes and understand the wealth of health services that are available during your golden years </li>
<li> Preparing to Leave a Legacy – our lives, relationships and stories matter. Find out why and how one could begin planning for their legacy for loved ones, and ways to be remembered with those who matter </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Plus, catch up with colleagues across agencies over a free cup (or two) of coffee and tea at our cosy coffee corner – don’t miss this one-stop opportunity to stay updated with the latest across the public service and to connect with old friends! <br>
