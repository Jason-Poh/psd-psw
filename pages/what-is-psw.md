### What is Public Service Week

<b>Public Service Week was inaugurated in 2008 as an annual event for public officers to build pride and a sense of belonging to the Public Service core values and recognise the good work done by public officers and agencies. </b> The tagline of PSW "Serving the Nation and Proud of it" is a strong commitment for us to continue to maintain our ethos of doing our best for Singapore. 
<br>
<br>
Public Service Week 2020 emphasises on the transformation as One Public Service in 3 areas: Work, Workforce and Workplace, where we create Our Future Public Service together, working together with citizens and stakeholders to build a better tomorrow for ourselves, our family and our Singapore.
