### What is Public Service Week

<b>Public Service Week was inaugurated in 2008 as an annual event for public officers to build pride and a sense of belonging to the Public Service core values and recognise the good work done by public officers and agencies. </b> The tagline of PSW. "Serving the Nation and Proud of it" is a strong commitment for us to continue to maintain our ethos of doing our best for Singapore. 
<br>
<br>
Public Service Week 2019 is aligned with the next phase of Public Sector Transformation, which emphasises the need for deep transformation to the core, to build a Future Public Service capable of building our Future Singapore.
